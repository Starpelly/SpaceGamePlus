## Building overview

Building Beef from source is not required for platforms that have binary distributions available (ie: Windows). 

Source code is available at https://github.com/beefytech/Beef.

### Bootstrapping

The core of the Beef compiler is written in C++, while the IDE and command-line BeefBuild build system is written in Beef itself. For bootstrapping purposes, Beef includes a minimal bootstrapping compiler whose sole job is to perform an initial BeefBuild build, which then performs a 'proper' build of itself.

### Building on Windows

#### Requirements

* Microsoft C++ build tools for Visual Studio 2017 or later. You can install just Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools or the entire Visual Studio suite from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022.
* Platform Toolset 141 (VS2017)
* Windows SDK 10.0.17763.0
* CMake 3.15 or newer
* Python 3.6 or newer
* Git command line tools

#### Build Steps
* Execute bin/build.bat

Note that this will first download and build LLVM, which will take some time.
The build results will be in IDE/dist

### Building on Linux and macOS

#### Requirements

* CMake 3.15 or newer
* LLVM-18
* Git

### Build Steps
